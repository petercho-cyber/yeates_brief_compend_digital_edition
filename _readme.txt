I chose to record categories like topic, book number, and chapter number because my book contained only text, and the book and chapter numbers may help to chronologically organize the pages. Also, the topic of each file may help to align the notes with the relevant chapter or book as well if there is no such number written on the page. Because of limited variation in media (only text as opposed to images or diagrams) it seemed more helpful to organize in terms of logistical factors and content.
I used a combination of ChatGPT and Transkribus to run HPT for my text. Because I do not have ChatGPT Premium, I was unable to upload more than 3 images to extract the text from in a 24 hour period. Therefore, although it was somewhat reliable with only a few errors, I was unable to use it consistently. Transkribus, I noticed, actually produced more errors for my specific text than did ChatGPT, mispelling simple words. However, it was easier to change errors, as you can see the image of the page right next to the transcription and correct spelling. Both systems produced more errors than I expected, likely because my text was handwritten by a student; it really made me think about cases in which handwritten texts are transcribed through online software. It was thought-provoking to imagine the labor that goes into correctly extracting text, and saddening to think that this work goes largely unrecognized and unpaid for.
