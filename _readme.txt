I chose to record categories like topic, book number, and chapter number because my book contained only text, and the book and chapter numbers may help to chronologically organize the pages. Also, the topic of each file may help to align the notes with the relevant chapter or book as well if there is no such number written on the page. Because of limited variation in media (only text as opposed to images or diagrams) it seemed more helpful to organize in terms of logistical factors and content.
