Of the Nature of Rights, & their Divisions.
A Right is “a Power or Claim established by
Law to act, possess, or obtain something from others.
As every Right answers to some Law, so Ob-
ligation answers to some Right, & has two Senses.

Rights are divided into perfect, imperfect or
external, alienable and unalienable.

The fundamental Principles of the Law of Na-
ture are 1st. That no man hurt another. 2d. That
every one as far as in his Power, should
contribute towards the general Interest of society.

the circumstances of Actions, we consider, 1st.
the Understanding, 2d. the Will, 3d. the Importance
of the action & Ability of the Agent.
