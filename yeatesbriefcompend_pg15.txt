Of the Several Sorts of Contracts
Cap.12
But as some Goods may be of that nature
that they cannot be divided to suit men's
Wants, and some may have Goods that his
neighbour does not want, but may trans-
fer to a third Person, this induced Men
to set a Price on Goods, & to make Use of
Gold & Silver. To maintain Commerce,
the Price of Goods must be settled, which
is commonly done in Gold & Silver, as
they are lasting, valuable, & portable,
and can be divided into all Manner of
Parts without Loss.
