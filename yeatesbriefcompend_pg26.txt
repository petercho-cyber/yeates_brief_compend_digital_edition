The Origin Civil Governments Book.3
The Origin of Civil Government
The Motives to Civil society under Govern-
ment are our Natural Approbations of
Virtue, and Fear of Injuries, as Mankind
are very depraved and Imperfect. The
Fear of Injuries is the stronger Motive; for
tho' Mankind were not so depraved, yet the
Multitude would not be inclined to aid those
in Distress, for Fear of incurring the Dis-
pleasure of a stronger Party.
The first Politics, it is very evident
cannot be ascribed to Force or the Violence
of ambitious men, for this Would be taking
for granted what we really dispute upon.
A State "is a Body of free men united under
one Government tor their common Interest,"
from which we may safely conclude, that
Polity is better than any Anarchy; for
there are no Evils peculiar to a civil life
under regular Government, but Men are
exposed to the like or Worse in a State of Nature
