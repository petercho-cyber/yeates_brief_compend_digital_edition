Chap.5 Several Parts of Supreme Powers
Cap.5 The Powers to be exercised towards Foreigners
are 1. That of making War for Defense of the State 
& 2. The Power of making Peace or main-
taining Commerce.
A Governor's smaller Rights are, the
bringing of Money, Conferring Civil Honours
Granting to Hold Fairs or Markets, Legiti
mating Children, Erecting Corporations 
pardoning Criminals, protecting Defense.
Those Persons have the Supreme Power
who are interested with the greater Branches
of Power, so that they can exert them ac-
cording to their own Judgement, and no Per-
son or Council rescind their Deeds.
Sometimes a Number of States enter into
a strict Alliance to constitute some one
Person or permanent Council for them
all, to whom they commit the Supreme 
Power, Such were the Achaean states.
