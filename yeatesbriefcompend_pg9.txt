Chap. 1.
Of the Law of Nature.

A Law is “the Will of those vested with 
just Power of Governing, declared to their 
Subjects, requiring certain Actions, and 
forbidding others, with Denunciations of Re
wards or Punishments.” In every Law 
there are two Parts, the Precept & Sanction.
The divine Laws are natural & positive (i.e. re-
vealed) necessary and not-necessary. The Laws 
of Nature are universal, & are divided into prima
ry & secondary. The grand Principles of the Law 
of Nature are Religion, Self-Love and Socia
bility.
